#Terms Of Play

This document contains the terms for playing on the Minecraft Mod Development Dev Server. Players must agree to all terms if they want to play on the dev server.

- Decompiling or modifying any of the files distributed as part of the MMD Dev Server download is completely forbidden.
- The MMD Dev Server may contain sensitive content which has not been publicly disclosed. Members of the server will not publish screenshots, live stream or videos which focus on said sensitive content. Dev Server Admins, along with the authors of said sensitive content can make exceptions to this rule. 
- The primary role of the MMD Dev Server is to test and promote mods that were created by members of the MMD community.
- All bugs, exceptions, and crashes should be reported to the MMD Dev Server issue tracker regardless of how insignificant they may seem.
- Any bugs which allow for exploitation should be reported privately.
- These terms may be updated at any time, provided an announcement is made. Playing on the server after the rules have been updated will be taken as acceptance of the new terms. 
- Violation of these terms will almost certainly result in a ban from the MMD Dev Server, and from the MMD community.
